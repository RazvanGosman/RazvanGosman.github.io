## Abstract
Memory tests such as the Stroop, Corsi, and Digit Span tests remain useful to quantify the relative memory of a user population.
Unfortunately, there is no current modern implementation of these tests. That is, we failed to find a device-portable and user-friendly version online. 
Therefore, we built one, and used it to administer the tests to groups of high school students.

## Demo 
A live demo is available [here](https://razvangosman.github.io/). The results appear on the final screen for the experimenters to collect.

## Local Testing
This repository was built with react. It can be run locally as any other React application.
Please note that this `main` branch contains the production build. Navigate to the `development` branch for local testing.
* `npm install`
* `npm run` 

The sequences of each test may be altered in the `src\data\{test-name}Sequence.json` files.
